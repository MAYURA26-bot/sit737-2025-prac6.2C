### Step 4: Rebuild and Push Docker Image
- docker build -t mayura1994/calculator-microservice-6.2c .
- docker push mayura1994/calculator-microservice-6.2c

### Step 5: Update deployment.yaml
Update the image name in your deployment configuration:

containers:
  - name: calculator
    image: mayura1994/calculator-microservice-6.2c

Apply the changes:
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml

### Step 6: Re-Access Updated App in Browser
